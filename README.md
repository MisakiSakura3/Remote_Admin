# Remote_Admin
Remote Admin is a software to remotely control a minecraft server. It allows for different people to have control of a server at different levels of access. Open source, highly configurable.


Guide to Configuration:<br/><br/>
    Remote Admin CLIENT<br/><br/>
in "ip_address" enter the address that you are going to use for the connection. (The minecraft server address, most likely)<br/>
in "ip_port" enter the port that you want to use for Remote Admin (AVOID <1024, 25565 and 25575)<br/>
in "encryption_pass" enter the password that you want to use for AES-256 encryption. I recommend a strong one, with letters and numbers.<br/>
"ip_port" and "encryption_pass" must match in the Remote Admin Server configuration file.<br/>
